# Quick Start Guide for Players

Welcome to the Tactical Sailing Simulator! This guide will help you get started playing your first race.

## What is TSS?

The Tactical Sailing Simulator (TSS) is a turn-based sailing race simulator that helps you understand and practice sailing tactics, especially how wind shifts affect boat performance and positioning.

## Your First Race

### Step 1: Select a Wind Scenario

1. Look at the **left sidebar** - you'll see a wind scenario selector at the top
2. Choose a wind scenario:
   - **Pendulum**: Wind swings back and forth
   - **Oscillating**: Wind oscillates in a pattern
   - **Persistent Shift**: Wind shifts in one direction
   - **Random**: Unpredictable wind changes
   - **Static**: No wind changes (good for learning basics)

3. Click on a scenario to select it - this creates a new game

### Step 2: Add Players

1. Click the **"Add"** button to add a human player
2. Click the **"🤖 AI"** button to add an AI opponent
   - AI players automatically make decisions each turn
   - You can choose difficulty: Easy, Medium, or Hard
3. You can add multiple players (up to 6)
4. Each player gets a unique color

### Step 3: Position Your Boats

1. Before starting, you can drag boats on the start line to position them
2. Use the **start position buttons** (1, 2, 3) to change a boat's position:
   - **1**: Left side of start line
   - **2**: Middle of start line
   - **3**: Right side of start line
3. Each boat can be renamed by clicking on its name

### Step 4: Start the Race

1. Click the **"Start Race"** button (at the bottom center of the screen)
2. This locks the wind scenario and boat positions
3. The race begins!

### Step 5: Play Turns

Each turn, you'll:

1. **Select actions for each boat**:
   - **Forward** (→): Continue sailing on current tack
   - **Tack** (↻): Change tack (switch from port to starboard or vice versa)
   - **To Mark** (⛵): Sail directly toward the windward mark (only available when close)

2. **For AI players**: They automatically choose their action - you'll see a 🤖 badge next to their name

3. **Click "Next Turn"** to advance the game

4. **Use "Back"** to undo the last turn (if you make a mistake)

## Understanding the Game

### The Game Canvas

- **Grid**: Shows distances (each square = 1 boat length)
- **Marks**: Red buoys show the race course
  - Start line: Bottom of the course
  - Windward mark: Top of the course
- **Boat Tracks**: Colored lines show where each boat has sailed
- **Wind Indicator**: Top-left shows current wind direction

### Boat Actions Explained

#### Forward (→)
- Continues sailing on the current tack
- Boat responds to wind shifts automatically
- Use this most of the time

#### Tack (↻)
- Switches from port tack to starboard tack (or vice versa)
- Use when:
  - Wind shifts favor the other tack
  - You need to change course
  - You're getting too close to a boundary

#### To Mark (⛵)
- Sails directly toward the windward mark
- Only available when close to the mark
- Useful for finishing the race
- **Smart Mode**: Automatically evaluates wind shifts and can tack if beneficial, so you don't ignore major wind shifts when heading to the mark

### Tactical Information

Each player card shows:
- **VMG**: Velocity Made Good (how fast you're progressing toward the mark)
- **Lift/Header**: Whether the wind shift helps or hurts you
- **Distance to Mark**: How far you are from the windward mark
- **Tack**: Whether you're on port (left) or starboard (right) tack

### Settings

Click the **⚙️ Settings** button to:
- Show/hide grid lines
- Show/hide boat tracks
- Show/hide tactical indicators
- Adjust other visual options

## Tips for Success

1. **Watch the Wind**: Wind shifts can make or break your race
   - A **lift** improves your angle to the mark
   - A **header** worsens your angle
   - Tacking at the right time is crucial!

2. **Use VMG**: Higher VMG means you're making better progress
   - Try to maximize VMG when sailing upwind
   - Sometimes sailing slightly off the direct course gives better VMG

3. **Position Matters**: Starting position affects your race
   - Middle start (position 2) is usually safest
   - Left or right start can give advantages in certain wind scenarios

4. **Practice with AI**: Start with Easy AI opponents to learn
   - Watch what they do
   - Try different strategies
   - Gradually increase difficulty

5. **Experiment**: Try different wind scenarios
   - Each scenario teaches different tactics
   - Random wind is great for practicing quick decisions

## Common Scenarios

### Starting the Race
- Position boats on the start line
- Choose your starting position (left, middle, or right)
- Click "Start Race" when ready

### During the Race
- Each turn, select Forward, Tack, or To Mark for each boat
- Watch for wind shifts (check the wind indicator)
- Use tactical cards to see VMG and lift/header
- Click "Next Turn" to advance

### Finishing
- When close to the windward mark, "To Mark" becomes available
- Use it to sail directly to the mark
- First boat to reach the mark wins!

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Space**: Advance to next turn (when available)
- **Esc**: Close modals/dialogs

## Understanding Race Insights

Each player card shows detailed tactical information including:
- **VMG** (Velocity Made Good) - Your speed toward the mark
- **Lift/Header** - Wind shift effects
- **Angle to Wind** - How efficiently you're sailing
- **Tack Advantage** - Whether to stay or tack
- And much more!

See the **[Race Insights Guide](./RACE_INSIGHTS.md)** for a complete explanation of all metrics and how to use them.

## Getting Help

- Click the **"?"** button in the top-right for more detailed help
- Check the tactical cards for real-time boat performance
- Read the [Race Insights Guide](./RACE_INSIGHTS.md) to understand all metrics
- Experiment with different strategies to learn what works

## Next Steps

1. **Play your first race**: Follow the steps above
2. **Try different wind scenarios**: Each teaches different tactics
3. **Race against AI**: Start with Easy, work your way up
4. **Experiment**: Try different strategies and see what works
5. **Learn the tactics**: Read about VMG, lift/header, and optimal angles

Have fun sailing! ⛵
