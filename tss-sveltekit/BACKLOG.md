## 🎯 High Priority Features

### 0. Contextual Help for Race Insights

**Priority**: 🔴 Critical  
**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days  
**Actual Effort**: ~2 days

#### Description
Add contextual help icons (ℹ️) next to every insight/metric in the race insights panel. When users hover over the icon, they should see a tooltip explaining what that metric means and how to interpret it.

#### Requirements
- **Help Icons**:
  - Add "i" (info) icon next to each metric/insight
  - Icons should be subtle but discoverable
  - Consistent styling across all metrics

- **Tooltips**:
  - Show on hover (desktop) or tap (mobile)
  - Clear, concise explanations
  - Examples when helpful
  - Link to full documentation (optional)

- **Metrics to Document**:
  - Angle to Wind (ATW)
  - VMG (Velocity Made Good)
  - Lift/Header indicators
  - Wind Shift
  - Mode (FOOTING, PINCHING, VMG MODE, etc.)
  - Heading (HDG vs OPT)
  - Tack Advantage
  - Speed
  - Power state (OVERPOWERED, UNDERPOWERED, POWERED)
  - Decision flags (TACK SOON, TACK NOW)
  - Position badge
  - Tack indicator

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Info icon (ℹ️) appears next to each metric
- [x] Modal shows on click (desktop and mobile)
- [x] Explanations are clear and concise
- [x] Modals don't interfere with UI interactions
- [x] Accessible (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- [x] Consistent styling across all metrics
- [x] History charts for VMG, ATW, Heading, and Tack Advantage
- [x] Context-aware guidance based on current status

#### Technical Notes
- ✅ Created reusable `Modal` component (already existed)
- ✅ Used click-based modals (better for mobile than hover)
- ✅ Created chart components: `VMGChart`, `ATWChart`, `HeadingChart`, `TackAdvantageChart`
- ✅ History tracking for all metrics (60 turns)
- ✅ Turn-based X-axis (not time-based)
- ✅ Performance bands with color coding
- ✅ ARIA labels and keyboard navigation implemented

#### UI/UX Considerations
- ✅ Modal appears on click (works on all devices)
- ✅ Modal can be closed via backdrop, Escape key, or close button
- ✅ Charts show historical trends over last 60 turns
- ✅ Context-aware guidance updates based on current status
- ✅ Consistent visual hierarchy across all modals

#### Completed Metrics
- ✅ **VMG (Velocity Made Good)**: Full modal with history chart, performance bands, optimal VMG reference line
- ✅ **ATW (Angle to Wind)**: Full modal with history chart, target angle reference, pinching/footing guidance
- ✅ **Heading**: Full modal with history chart showing heading vs optimal, wind shift awareness
- ✅ **Tack Advantage**: Full modal with history chart showing advantage percentage, positive/negative zones

#### Implementation Details
- All modals follow consistent pattern: Hero stat → Supporting indicators → History chart → Guidance
- Charts use SVG for performance and scalability
- History persists across modal opens/closes
- Turn-based tracking ensures accurate representation for turn-based gameplay

## 🎯 High Priority Features

### 1. Wind Zones UI Improvements

**Priority**: 🔴 High  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Estimated Effort**: 1 day

#### Description
Improve the visual design of wind zones. The current circle/arc visualization is too large and can be distracting or cover important game elements.

#### Requirements
- **Size Reduction**:
  - Reduce the size of wind zone circles/arcs
  - Make them more subtle and less intrusive
  - Ensure they're still visible but don't dominate the canvas

- **Visual Refinement**:
  - Adjust opacity/transparency for better visibility balance
  - Consider alternative visualizations (thinner arcs, dashed lines, etc.)
  - Ensure wind zones don't obscure boats, marks, or tracks

- **User Control**:
  - Keep the toggle to show/hide wind zones
  - Consider adding opacity slider in settings
  - Ensure zones are still informative when visible

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Wind zone circles/arcs are smaller and less intrusive
- [ ] Zones don't obscure important game elements
- [ ] Still clearly visible and informative
- [ ] Visual design is polished and professional
- [ ] Settings allow users to control visibility/opacity

#### Technical Notes
- Modify `WindZones.svelte` component
- Adjust SVG circle/arc radius calculations
- Update opacity and stroke width values
- May need to adjust z-index/layering
- Test with different screen sizes

### 3. Speed-Based Movement System

**Priority**: 🔴 High  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-5 days

#### Description
Implement speed variations based on sailing angle relative to optimal power. Boats should advance different distances depending on whether they're sailing at the optimal angle for power or not.

#### Requirements
- **Speed Calculation**: 
  - Optimal angle (45° ATW) = Full speed (1.0 unit per turn)
  - Pinching (too close to wind, <42° ATW) = Reduced speed (e.g., 0.7-0.9 units)
  - Footing (too wide, >50° ATW) = Reduced speed (e.g., 0.7-0.9 units)
  - Speed should vary smoothly based on angle to wind

- **Movement Impact**:
  - Boats sailing at optimal angle advance full distance
  - Boats pinching or footing advance less distance per turn
  - Visual feedback showing speed differences

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Speed varies based on angle to wind (ATW)
- [ ] Optimal angle (45°) provides full speed
- [ ] Pinching reduces speed proportionally
- [ ] Footing reduces speed proportionally
- [ ] Movement distance reflects speed changes
- [ ] Visual indicators show speed differences

#### Technical Notes
- Modify `BoatMovementService` to calculate speed multiplier based on ATW
- Update movement calculations to use speed multiplier
- Consider using polar diagram data for realistic speed curves
- May need to update `TacticalAnalysisService` for speed calculations

### 4. Racing Rules Implementation

**Priority**: 🔴 High  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Estimated Effort**: 5-7 days

#### Description
Implement sailing racing rules, particularly right-of-way rules. Boats on starboard tack have right-of-way over boats on port tack.

#### Requirements
- **Right-of-Way Rules**:
  - Starboard tack has right-of-way over port tack
  - Port tack must keep clear and avoid starboard tack boats
  - Same tack: windward boat keeps clear of leeward boat
  - Overtaking boat keeps clear

- **Collision Detection**:
  - Detect when boats would collide
  - Prevent movement that would cause collision
  - Show warnings when boats are too close

- **Penalties**:
  - 360° turn penalty for rule violations
  - Optional: 720° turn for serious violations
  - Visual indication of penalty turns

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Starboard tack boats have right-of-way
- [ ] Port tack boats must keep clear
- [ ] Collision detection prevents illegal moves
- [ ] Penalty system for rule violations
- [ ] Visual indicators for right-of-way situations
- [ ] Warnings when boats are on collision course

#### Technical Notes
- Create `RacingRulesService` in domain layer
- Implement collision detection algorithm
- Add penalty turn system
- Update `BoatMovementService` to check rules before movement
- May need to add "keep clear" indicators in UI

Add comprehensive end-of-game statistics and enhanced track visualization with tack markers and VMG-based color gradients.

#### Requirements

**Track Visualization**:
- **Tack Markers**: Mark points where boats tacked on the track
  - Visual markers (e.g., circles, arrows) at tack points
  - Show tack direction (port ↔ starboard)
  - Optional: Show tack number/sequence

- **VMG-Based Color Gradient**:
  - Color track segments based on VMG efficiency
  - Green = High VMG (95%+)
  - Yellow = Medium VMG (85-95%)
  - Red = Low VMG (<85%)
  - Smooth gradient transitions between segments

**End-of-Game Statistics**:
- **Race Summary**:
  - Finish times and positions
  - Total distance sailed
  - Average VMG
  - Number of tacks
  - Time on each tack (port vs starboard)

- **Tack Analysis**:
  - List of all tacks with timestamps
  - VMG before/after each tack
  - Wind conditions at each tack
  - Effectiveness of each tack (did it improve VMG?)

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Best VMG achieved
  - Worst VMG period
  - Time spent in different modes (VMG MODE, FOOTING, PINCHING)
  - Wind shift responses (how many lifts/headers detected)

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tack markers visible on boat tracks
- [ ] Track colored by VMG efficiency (gradient)
- [ ] End-of-game statistics panel
- [ ] Tack-by-tack analysis
- [ ] Performance metrics summary
- [ ] Export statistics (optional: JSON/CSV)

#### Technical Notes
- Enhance `Boat.saveTurn()` to track tack events
- Create `GameStatisticsService` for stat calculations
- Update track rendering in `GameCanvas.svelte`
- Add statistics panel component
- May need to store additional turn data (VMG at each turn)
